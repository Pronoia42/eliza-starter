*initiation prompt*: `Rewrite this page to match the current project status` 

To ensure that the `current-issues.md` document remains relevant and useful, follow these guidelines when updating it:

1. **Identify New Issues**:
   - Review the project and gather feedback from the user to identify any new issues that arise during development.
   - Document any bugs, performance issues, or feature requests that need attention.

2. **Prioritize Issues**:
   - Assign priority levels to each issue based on its impact on the project. Use a simple scale (e.g., High, Medium, Low) to help the team focus on critical problems first.

3. **Provide Clear Descriptions**:
   - For each issue, include a brief description that outlines the problem, its context, and any relevant details that can help in troubleshooting or resolution.

4. **Update Status Regularly**:
   - As issues are addressed, update their status in the document. Mark them as resolved or in progress, and provide any necessary comments or notes on the resolution process.

5. **Review and Revise**:
   - Periodically review the document to remove resolved issues and ensure that it reflects the current state of the project. This helps keep the document concise and focused.

6. **Communicate Changes**:
   - Share updates with the team during meetings or through project management tools to keep everyone informed about the current issues and their statuses.

By following these guidelines, you can maintain an effective and up-to-date `current-issues.md` document that supports your development efforts and enhances project management.
