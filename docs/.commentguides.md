Here are some guidelines for writing comments in code to ensure clarity and understanding of functions and their usage:

1. **Explain the Purpose of the Function**: 
   Start with a concise summary of what the function does. Avoid repeating the function name in the comment. Use clear and concise language without jargon unless it's widely understood.

2. **Describe the Arguments the Function Takes**: 
   List the parameters (arguments) the function expects and their data types. Explain what each argument represents and how it's used within the function.

3. **Explain What the Function Returns**: 
   Describe the data type and format of the value the function returns. If the function doesn't return a value, mention it explicitly (e.g., "This function performs an action and does not return a value").

4. **Add Comments for Complex Logic or Edge Cases**: 
   If the function involves complex logic or error handling, include comments to explain those sections for better understanding. Mention any edge cases the function might encounter and how it handles them.

5. **Use Code Formatting Consistently**: 
   Maintain consistent formatting for comments throughout your codebase. This improves readability for both humans and AI agents.

6. **Follow Coding Style Guides**: 
   Adhere to the established coding conventions and style guides for your programming language or project.

7. **Consider Including Examples**: 
   When appropriate, add code examples demonstrating how to use the function with different inputs. This can be particularly helpful for AI agents that learn by example. Here's an example following these guidelines:

```python
  def calculate_area(length: float, width: float) -> float:
      """Calculates the area of a rectangle.

      Args:
          length (float): The length of the rectangle.
          width (float): The width of the rectangle.

      Returns:
          float: The area of the rectangle (length x width).
      """
      return length * width  # Function body to calculate area
```


Feel free to adjust any part of this document to better fit your project's context!

By following these guidelines, you can write comments that are informative for both human developers and AI agents, making it easier to understand, use, and maintain your code.
